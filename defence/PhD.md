## **2** Foundation and Tools

Start from: What is mathematics ?
Then Foundation
Then Function, leads to logic
Logic allows for sets and graphs
Hypergraphs

---

## **3** Knowledge Representation

Knowledge in practice.
Grammars
DL
Ontologies

---

## **3** Knowledge Representation

Problem with Ontologies
Grammar
Inference of meta-rules
Definition by structure
Example

---

## **4** General Planning Formalism

What is planning ?
Example
How to formalize ?
Fluents and State
How Actions can be everything ?
Search Space
General Algorithm
Examples of paradigms

---

## **5** COLOR Framework

PDDL
Existing languages per paradigms…
Our framework.
VS PDDL

---

## **6** Online and Flexible Planning Algorithms

What is real time ?
PSP + Existing
HTN + Existing
1. LOLLIPOP
2. HEART

---

## **7** Toward Intent Recognition

What is intent recognition ?
Classical techniques
Inverted Planning + Existing
How Our work can be exploited

---

## **8** Conclusion and Perspectives
