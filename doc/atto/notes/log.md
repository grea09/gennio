!!!! Currying = valuation = meta ????!!???

Also when currying the definition of $\gtrdot$ we obtains an interesting function.

::: {.definition #def:valuation name="Valuation"}
The valuation function turns any formula of function into its simplest value. We note the valuation of a function $[[x]]$ and define it as $x \to (\gtrdot \to x)$.^[$[[]] = x \to (\gtrdot \to x)$].
:::

If we compute its *inverse* (see @later) it becomes the *lifting function* (notted $]][[$) that turns any function into a variable. The currying of the definition of $\gtrdot$ can be noted as $]][[\gtrdot]][[$.


I need to redo most of it again …

**Missing days: 4**

I'm getting a "class" with a group of students soon. I'll try to resume my work after that. I need to finish the first chapter soon so I can catch up with the planned advancement.

$\chi = v \to \{ e: v \in \chi(e) \}$
$\chi = e \to \{ v: e \in \chi(v) \}$

Barelly got anything done. But I did work.

Starting…

Member function $\in = x, S \to ?????$

$S = \gtrdot \to x$ with $x$ being a member of $S$
