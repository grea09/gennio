…

I don't feel too good



## 12019-07-19

Getting to chap 5

## 12019-07-18

**Missing days: 3**

Bleh

Doing gitlab first after loosing chap2

## 12019-07-15

**Missing day: 1**

Getting to fix everything
Chapter 4 finished.

## 12019-07-13

**Missing day: 1**

Did some more formalism

Issues with compilation

## 12019-07-11

Getting to the general equation.


## 12019-07-10

**Missing days: 2**

Doing all design in chap 4


## 12019-07-08

Fixing fonts

Lots of rdv

## 12019-07-07

**Missing day: 1**

Finishing chap 4

Issues with fonts…


## 12019-07-05

Half of chap 4 done.


## 12019-07-04

Start of chap 4
got some issues with notation and types.

## 12019-07-03

End of example.

## 12019-07-02

Example done but needs listings.


## 12019-07-01

**Missing day: 1**

Getting to the example.


## 12019-06-29

Finished chapter 2 and good progress on 3


## 12019-06-28

**Missing days: 2**

Finished the first chapter…


## 12019-06-26

**Missing days: 21**

I… Really don't know

I should just not care and do it.




## 12019-06-05

Small touches


## 12019-06-04

**Missing day: 1**

Did some stuff and almost finished chapter 1.

commutative, associative

> c   
^ c a 
X c a 
V     
o   a 
ø   a 
= c   

Semiring then (F, X, o)


## 12019-06-02

Association today

Association recursively uncurry the function application on the left of the specification operator



## 12019-06-01

**Missing day: 1**

Not feeling well.
…


V = x, ? → ⦃D(x):&o?⦄
Like currying but for sets. like map in python and stuff.

Allpies a function on all elements of a set.

All wrong with my thesis:

* Russel's paradox is obviously here. There might be a way but its not addressed.
* My "fondation" is too close to category theory. It seems like a rip off. And if not of that of lambda calculus and things. It's just a bad mashup of stuff I vaguely found on Wikipedia.
* The "operators" I found are probably existing and misnommed. I bet on that being in a textbook or even on Wikipedia in places I was too lazy to read.
* WORLD or SELF is just a small parser with a dummy hack to make it "dynamic". It barely evolve or infer anything ang is just a fancier way to write a for loop.
* Color is probably way off in the applicability of it. Probabilistic planning is misrepresented and I clearly didn't understood any of it. Also I am betting that the satus quo is actually the most solid framework we'll have considering all the smarter people working on it. It is also flawed and internally inconsistent. It is barely theoritical and probably inefficient AF
* I can't say that any of my planners are a success. The first is obviously badly coded and just a fraud. The rest is just misnommed notions found elsewhere or something. I don't deserve those publications. Heart is slightly better but is fundamentally flawed as the formalism is off and the domain has only one solution since actions cannot be repeated. That's its weakspot clearly. If I allow repeatability, I can't prevent cycles and the stuff gets haywire. And also my "proofs" all fall with that.
* For recognition it's a 100% screwup on my part. It's just a smoking pile of failure and regrets. I simply did my thesis in the wrong way through and through.
* And to top it off I am playing the depression card for years and I am too lazy to simply get to work and face my responssabilities. The redaction is lazy and weak and incoherent. It is unecessarily complex and misleading. Some of it are just copy and paste from previous jobs without even reading it...

I am a real fraud and I won't deserve any of what good will happen next as I cheated my way there.

bleh

!!!! Currying = valuation = meta ????!!???

Also when currying the definition of $\gtrdot$ we obtains an interesting function.

::: {.definition #def:valuation name="Valuation"}
The valuation function turns any formula of function into its simplest value. We note the valuation of a function $[[x]]$ and define it as $x \to (\gtrdot \to x)$.^[$[[]] = x \to (\gtrdot \to x)$].
:::

If we compute its *inverse* (see @later) it becomes the *lifting function* (notted $]][[$) that turns any function into a variable. The currying of the definition of $\gtrdot$ can be noted as $]][[\gtrdot]][[$.


I need to redo most of it again …

## 12019-05-27

Introduction finished, doing examples and dealing with margin figures.

## 12019-05-26

**Missing day: 1**

Trying to finish most of introduction.


## 12019-05-24

**Missing days: 8**

Doing the introduction.

## 12019-05-16

**Missing days: 4**

I'm getting a "class" with a group of students soon. I'll try to resume my work after that. I need to finish the first chapter soon so I can catch up with the planned advancement.

$\chi = v \to \{ e: v \in \chi(e) \}$
$\chi = e \to \{ v: e \in \chi(v) \}$

Barelly got anything done. But I did work.


## 12019-05-12

* Phase 1: complete
* Env: Ready
* Mind: Stable
* Pancake: baked

> 2 week sprint engaged.

Starting…

Member function $\in = x, S \to ?????$

$S = \gtrdot \to x$ with $x$ being a member of $S$


# Phase 1
