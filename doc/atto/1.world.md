# Knowledge representation

Knowledge representation is at the intersection of maths, logic, language and computer sciences. Its research begins in the end of the 19^th^ century, with Cantor inventing set theory [@cantor_property_1874]. Then after a crisis in the begining of the 20^th^ century with Russel's paradox and Gödel's incompletude theorem, revised versions of the set theory become one of the fundations of mathematics. The most accepted version is the Zermelo–Fraenkel axiomatic set theory with the axiom of Choice (ZFC) [@fraenkel_foundations_1973; @ciesielski_set_1997]. This effort was to represent mathematics in itself as a way to formalize its own expression.

A similar process happened in the 1970's, when logic based knowledge representation gained popularity among computer scientists [@baader_description_2003]. Systems at the time explored notions such as rules and networks to try and organize knowledge into a rigourous structure. At the same time other systems were built arround First Order Logic (FOL). Then, around the 1990's, the research began to merge in search of common semantics in what led to the developpement of Description Logics (DL). This domain is expressing knowledge as a hierarchy of classes containing individuals.

From there and with the advent of the world wide web, engineers were on the lookout for standardization and interoperability of computer systems. One such standardization took the name of "semantic web" and aimed to created a widespread network of connected services sharing knowledge between one another in a common language. At the begining of the 21^st^ century, several languages were created, all based around W3C specifications called Resource Description Framework (RDF) [@klyne_resource_2004]. This language is based around the notion of statements as triples. Each can store a unit of knowledge at a time. All the underlying theoritical work of DL continued with it and created more efficient and lighter derivatives. One such derivative is the family of languages called Web Ontology Language (OWL) [@horrocks_shiq_2003]. Ontologies and knowledge graphs are more recent names for the representation and definition of categories (DL classes), properties and relation between concepts, data and entities.

All these knowledge description systems rely on a syntax to interoperate systems and users to one another. The base of such language comes from the formalization of automated grammars by @chomsky_three_1956. It mostly consist in a set of hierarchical rules aiming to deconstruct an input string into a sequence of terminal symbols. This deconstruction is called parsing and is a common operation in computer science. More tools for the formalization of computer language emerged soon after thanks to @backus_syntax_1959 while working on a programming language at IBM. This is how the Backus–Naur Form (BNF) meta-language was created ontop of Chomsky's formalization.

All these tools are the base for all modern knowledge representations. In the rest of this chapter, we discuss the fundamentals of each of the aspects of knowledge description, then we propose a knowledge description framework that is able to adapt to its usage.

## Fundamentals

First and foremost, we present the list of notations in this document. While trying to stick to traditional notations, we also aim for an unambiguious notation across several domains while remaining concise and precise. In 
@tbl:symbols we present the list of all symbols and relations. When possible we use the classical mathematical operator and otherwise we prefer lower case greek letters for relations. @Tbl:sets lists all sets and general notions that we represent with uppercase letters.

### Fundation of maths and logic systems

In order to understand knowledge representation, some mathematical and logical tools need to be presented. 

#### Logic

The first mathematical notion we define is logic. More precisely First Order Logic (FOL) in the context of DL.

Introducing the two boolean values $\top$ *true* and $\bot$ *false* along with the classical boolean operators $\lnot$ *not*, $\land$ *and* and $\lor$ *or*. These are defined the following way :

* $\lnot \top = \bot$
* $a \land b \models (a = b = \top)$
* $\lnot(a \lor b) \models (a = b = \bot)$

With $a \models b$ being the logical implication also called entailement.

#### Set theory

We also need to define the notion of set. At the begining of his funding work on set theory, Cantor wrote:

> _A set is a gathering together into a whole of definite, distinct objects of our perception or of our thought—which are called elements of the set._ -- George @cantor_beitrage_1895

We then define a set the following way:

::: {.definition #def:set name="Set"}
A collection of *distinct* objects, considered as an object in its own right. We define a set one of two way (always using braces):

* In extension by listing all the elements in the set: $\{1,2,4\}$
* In intension by specifying the rule that all elements follow: $\{n: n\in\mathbb{N} \land (n\mod2=0)\}$
:::

This definition alone gives some properties of sets. By being able to distinguish elements in the set from one another we assert that elements have an identity and we can derive equality from there. We can also give the empty set $\emptyset$ as the set with no elements. Since two sets are equals if and only if they have precisely the same elements, the empty set is unique. The member relation is noted $e \in E$ to indicate that $e$ is an element of $E$.
We note $S \subset G : (e \in S \models e\in G) \land S \neq G$, that a set $S$ is a proper subset of a more general set $G$.

We also define the union and intersection as following:

* $E \cup F : \{e : e \in E \lor e \in F \}$
* $E \cap F : \{e : e \in E \land e \in F \}$

#### Graphs

Next in line, we need to define a few notion of graph theory.

::: {.definition #def:graph name="Graph"}
A graph is a mathematical structure $g=(V,E)$ consisting of vertices $V$ (also called nodes) and edges $E$ (arcs) that links two vertices together. Each edge is basically a pair of vertices ordered or not depending if the the graph is directed or not.
:::

We provide graphs with an adjacence function $\phi$ over any vertex $v \in V$ such that:

* $\phi(v) = \{ e \in E : v \in e \}$
* $\phi^+(v) = \{ \langle v, v' \rangle \in E : v' \in V \}$ **dirrected**
* $\phi^-(v) = \{ \langle v', v \rangle \in E : v' \in V \}$

And an incidence function using the same name over any edges $e = \langle v, v' \rangle \in E$ such that:

* $\phi(e) =  \langle v, v' \rangle$
* $\phi^-(e) = v$
* $\phi^+(e) = v'$

Properties of graphs are better explained relative to their *transitive cover* $\chi^*$ of a graph $g = (V,E)$ defined as follow:

* $\chi(g) = (V,E') : E' = E \cup \{ \langle v_1, v_3 \rangle : \{ \langle v_1, v_2 \rangle, \langle v_2, v_3 \rangle \} \subset E \}$
* $\chi^2 = \chi \circ \chi$
* $\chi^n = \bigcirc_{i=0}^n \chi$
* $\chi^* = \bigcirc^{\infty} \chi$

Now we present two additional notions on graphs.

::: {.definition #def:path name="Path"}
We say that vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$ are *connected* if it exists a path from one to the other. Said otherwise, there is a path from $v_1$ to $v_2$ if and only if $\langle v_1, v_2 \rangle \in E_{\chi^*(g)}$.
:::

Similarly we define *cycles* as the existence of a path from a given vertex to itself.

**aciclicity**

#### Hypergraphs

A generalization of graphs are **hypergraphs** where the edges are allowed to connect more than two vertices. An hypergraph is *$n$-uniform* when the edges are restricted to connect only $n$ vertices together. In that regard, classical graphs are 2-uniform hypergraphs.

Another variant of graphs are graphs with the special case where $E \subset V$. This means that edges are allowed to connect to other edges. These kind of graphs are a generalization of hypergraphs. Informations about these kind of structures for knowledge reare hard to come by and rely mostly on a form of "folk wisdom" where knowledge is rarely published and mostly transmitted orally during lessons. One of the closest information is this forum post [@kovitz_terminology_2018] that associated this type of graph to port graphs [@silberschatz_port_1981]. 
Additional information was found in the form of a contribution of @vepstas_hypergraph_2008 on an encyclopedia article about hypergraphs. In that contribution, he says that a generalization of hypergraph allowing for edge-to-edge connections violates the axiom of fundation of ZFC by allowing edge-loops.

This shows the limits of standard mathematics especially on the field of knowledge representation. Some strucutres needs higher dimensions than allowed by the one dimensional structure of ZFC and FOL.

However, it is important to not be mistaken: such non-standard set theories are more general than ZFC and therefore contains ZFC as a subset. All is a matter of restrictions.

#### Sheaf

In order to understand sheaves, we need to present a few auxiliary notions. Most of these definitions are adapted from [@vepstas_sheaves_2008]. The first of which is a seed.

::: {.definition #def:seed name="Seed"}
A seed correspond to a vertex along with the set of adjacent edges. Formally we not a seed $(v, \phi_g(v))$ that means that a seed build from vertex $v$ in the graph $g$ contains a set of adjacent edges $\phi_g(v)$. We call the vertex $v$ the *germ* of the seed.
:::

Now we can build a kind of partial graphs from seeds called sections.

::: {.definition #def:section name="section"}
A section is a set of seeds that have their common edges connected. This means that if two seeds have an edge in common connecting both germs, then the seeds are connected in the section and the edges are merged.
