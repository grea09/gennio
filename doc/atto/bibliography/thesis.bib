  title = {{Comportements d'Agents en Mouvement : Une Approche Cognitive pour la Reconnaissance d'Intentions}},
  abstract = {Cette recherche recouvre des int\'er\^ets majeurs notamment pour les applications traitant de la surveillance d'une zone par exemple : circulation maritime, feux de for\^ets, d\'eplacement de troupes, etc. Automatiser une telle t\^ache ou, tout au moins, assister un op\'erateur dans l'accomplissement de cette t\^ache, n\'ecessite de d\'evelopper un syst\`eme d'interpr\'etation de situations capable, \`a partir d'observations de nature tr\`es diverse et arrivant de mani\`ere erratique (position, vitesse, type.), de caract\'eriser progressivement et de mieux en mieux chacune des entit\'es concern\'ees. Ce syst\`eme doit ensuite raisonner afin d'identifier les comportements possibles (individuels ou collectifs) de chacune de ces entit\'es et donc par voie de cons\'equence, \^etre capable d'en d\'eduire des indications sur leurs intentions.

Les probl\'ematiques techniques que nous nous attacherons \`a r\'esoudre seront multiples. En effet, il sera tout d'abord essentiel de pouvoir disposer de techniques et d'algorithmes permettant de prendre en compte l'absence de donn\'ees et ce potentiellement sur de longues p\'eriodes d'observations (zone de couverture d'une patrouille maritime limit\'ee). De plus, les sc\'enarios envisag\'es nous imposent de pouvoir consid\'erer les intentions de groupes d'agents, tels que deux navires exhibant des comportements individuels diff\'erents, mais agissant dans un but commun. Enfin, un probl\`eme difficile sera \`a r\'esoudre, \`a savoir la reconnaissance du comportement r\'ecursif d'un agent en cours d'ex\'ecution (absence d'amor{\c c}age).

Le r\'esultat attendu de la th\`ese est la possibilit\'e offerte \`a un expert du domaine associ\'e \`a un \guillemotleft{} cogniticien \guillemotright{} de constituer la base des connaissances n\'ecessaires \`a la d\'etermination des intentions des agents observ\'es. Pour cela un langage de repr\'esentation sera d\'efini ainsi que les algorithmes de reconnaissance capables de l'exploiter. Un d\'emonstrateur appliqu\'e \`a l'un des sc\'enarios de surveillance pr\'ec\'edemment d\'ecrits sera r\'ealis\'e.},

@phdthesis{bonchek-dokow_cognitive_2012,
  title = {Cognitive {{Modeling}} of {{Human Intention Recognition}}},
  abstract = {Human beings, from the very young age of 18 months, have been shown to be able to extrapolate intentions from actions. That is, upon viewing another human executing a series of actions, an observing child can guess the underlying intention, even before the goal has been achieved, and even when the performer failed at achieving the goal. In this work, we propose a cognitive model of this human ability, namely, that of intention recognition. The proposed model deals with the challenge of recognizing the intention of an observed sequence of actions, performed by some acting agent. Intention recognition is apparently one of the core components of social cognition. Such a model is therefore important both from a cognitive science point of view and from an engineering perspective. It could provide a deeper understanding of normal and pathological development of human social cognition processes, as well as allowing for artificial implementation of this ability in software agents and physical robots, towards the end of creating more socially intelligent artificial beings. Much work has already been done in all the many areas touching upon this topic, from psychology through neuroscience to artificial intelligence and engineering. In this work we aim to address those aspects of intention recognition which have not yet been treated satisfactorily. We provide a high-level overview of the process as a whole, and detail this model in a way which can explain how \textbackslash{}emphfailed sequences of actions can be dealt with and their underlying intention extracted, and how \textbackslash{}emphnovel objects can be dealt with, and goals regarding them predicted, although there is\textemdash{}seemingly\textemdash{}no prior knowledge about them. We elaborate on two components of our proposed model, which we believe to be at its core, namely, those of intention detection and intention prediction. By \textbackslash{}emphintention detection we mean the ability to discern whether or not a sequence of actions has any underlying intention at all, or whether it was performed in an arbitrary manner with no goal in mind. By \textbackslash{}emphintention prediction we mean the ability to extend an incomplete sequence of actions to its most likely intended goal. The overall structure of the model, i.e. its components and the connections between them, is justified by psychological theories and supported by a plethora of empirical results reviewed in the relevant literature. These theories and experiments are referred to appropriately throughout this work. As for the two core modules on which we elaborate\textemdash{}Intention Detection and Intention Prediction\textemdash{}we present results from several experiments which we have designed and implemented for this purpose. The Intention Detection module is based on a measure of intention, which captures a notion of efficiency, in keeping with the Principle of Rational Action, which states that intentions are brought about by the most rational means available to the actor. This module is validated by two experiments. The first is an artificial emulation of the original intention re-enactment procedure by Meltzoff (1995). The results show that the proposed measure of intention indeed succeeds at categorizing streams of action according to the extent to which they convey an underlying intention. The second experiment validating the Intention Detection module is closer to real life. It uses surveillance videos taken from an online database, and analyzes them according to the proposed measure of intention. This analysis is then compared to human judgment of intention on the same videos. The resulting correlation between the output of our module and that of the human subjects is high, showing once again that our measure of intention indeed captures the notion of intention present in action. Like the Intention Detection module, the Intention Prediction module is based on a measure of intention as well. This measure is also designed to be in line with the Principle of Rational Action, however, it is formalized differently, for reasons which will be discussed. The Intention Prediction module also makes use of the psychological notion of \textbackslash{}emphaffordances, for extracting goal states from objects in the environment, which the observed actions might possibly be intending to realize. In order to test this second measure of intention as far as its usefulness for predicting intention, we designed an online experiment in which human subjects were presented with abstract objects (various geometric shapes), and were asked to predict the end-configuration of the objects, which observed sequences of movements were aiming to achieve. The predictions arrived at by our measure of intention were compared to the human results, and proved to be highly reliable. Other possible measures, such as proximity of the terminal state arrived at by the actions to the various goals, were also considered. However the success of these measures at predicting the intended goal was inferior to that of our measure of intention, and they at most play a secondary role in the process. To conclude our work, we summarize our findings and propose several directions for future research on intention modeling. We hope this work will be of interest and of use to researchers in the multidisciplinary communities dealing with intention recognition, and look forward to seeing the ideas proposed here implemented in socially cognitive artificial systems.},

  title = {Keyhole {{Adversarial Plan Recognition}} for {{Recognition}} of {{Suspicious}} and {{Anomalous Behavior}}},
  abstract = {A key application of plan recognition is to adversarial settings. There are two approaches to adversarial plan recognition. The first is \textbackslash{}emphsuspicious activity recognition, i.e., directly recognizing plans, activities and behaviors that are known to be suspect (e.g., carrying a suitcase, then leaving it behind in a dense area). The second is \textbackslash{}emphanomalous activity recognition, in which we \emph{indirectly} recognize suspect behavior, by first ruling out normal, non-suspect, behaviors as explanations for the observations. Different challenges are raised in pursuing these two approaches. In this work we present set of efficient plan recognition algorithms that are capable of handling the variety of challenges required of realistic adversarial plan recognition tasks. We describe an efficient hybrid adversarial plan recognition system that is composed of two processes: a plan recognizer capable of efficiently detecting anomalous behavior, and a utility-based plan-recognizer (UPR) incorporating the observer's own biases\textemdash{}in the form of a utility function\textemdash{}into the plan recognition process. This allows choosing recognition hypotheses based on their expected cost to the observer. These two components form a highly efficient adversarial plan recognizer capable of recognizing abnormal and potentially dangerous activities. We evaluate the system with extensive experiments, using real-world and simulated activity data, from a variety of sources.},

Fuzzy logic has been extended to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false.[1] Furthermore, when linguistic variables are used, these degrees may be managed by specific functions. Irrationality can be described in terms of what is known as the fuzzjective.[2]},

Superficially characterized by the implementation of an agent's beliefs, desires and intentions, it actually uses these concepts to solve a particular problem in agent programming. In essence, it provides a mechanism for separating the activity of selecting a plan (from a plan library or an external planner application) from the execution of currently active plans. Consequently, BDI agents are able to balance the time spent on deliberating about plans (choosing what to do) and executing those plans (doing it). A third activity, creating the plans in the first place (planning), is not within the scope of the model, and is left to the system designer and programmer.},

The notion of a semantic reasoner generalizes that of an inference engine, by providing a richer set of mechanisms to work with. The inference rules are commonly specified by means of an ontology language, and often a description language. Many reasoners use first-order predicate logic to perform reasoning; inference commonly proceeds by forward chaining and backward chaining. There are also examples of probabilistic reasoners, including Pei Wang's non-axiomatic reasoning system, and probabilistic logic networks.},

It was first developed by Drew McDermott and his colleagues in 1998 (inspired by STRIPS and ADL among others) mainly to make the 1998/2000 International Planning Competition (IPC) possible, and then evolved with each competition. "The adoption of a common formalism for describing planning domains fosters far greater reuse of research and allows more direct comparison of systems and approaches, and therefore supports faster progress in the field. A common formalism is a compromise between expressive power (in which development is strongly driven by potential applications) and the progress of basic research (which encourages development from well-understood foundations). The role of a common formalism as a communication medium for exchange demands that it is provided with a clear semantics."[1]},

  title = {F-Logic},

  abstract = {F-logic (frame logic) is a knowledge representation and ontology language. F-logic combines the advantages of conceptual modeling with object-oriented, frame-based languages and offers a declarative, compact and simple syntax, as well as the well-defined semantics of a logic-based language. Features include, among others, object identity, complex objects, inheritance, polymorphism, query methods, encapsulation. F-logic stands in the same relationship to object-oriented programming as classical predicate calculus stands to relational database programming.
F-logic was developed by Michael Kifer at Stony Brook University and Georg Lausen at the University of Mannheim. F-logic was originally developed for deductive databases, but is now most frequently used for semantic technologies, especially the Semantic Web. F-logic is considered as one of the formalisms for ontologies, but description logic (DL) is more popular and accepted, as is the DL-based OWL.
A development environment for F-logic was developed in the NeOn project and is also used in a range of applications for information integration, question answering and semantic search. Prior to the version 4 of Prot\'eg\'e ontology editor, F-Logic is supported as one of the two kinds of ontology.
The frame syntax of the Rule Interchange Format Basic Logic Dialect (RIF BLD) standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium is based on F-logic; RIF BLD however does not include non-monotonic reasoning features of F-logic.
In contrast to description logic based ontology formalism the semantics of F-logic are normally that of a closed world assumption as opposed to DL's open world assumption. Also, F-logic is generally undecidable, whereas the SHOIN description logic that OWL DL is based on is decidable. However it is possible to represent more expressive statements in F-logic than are possible with description logics.
The most comprehensive description of F-logic appears in. The preliminary paper  has won the 1999 Test of Time Award from ACM SIGMOD. A followup paper  has won the 2002 Test of Time Award from ACM SIGMOD.},

Backward chaining is implemented in logic programming by SLD resolution. Both rules are based on the modus ponens inference rule.

Inference engines work primarily in one of two modes: forward chaining and backward chaining. Forward chaining starts with the known facts and asserts new facts. Backward chaining starts with goals, and works backward to determine what facts must be asserted so that the goals can be achieved.},

Prolog has its roots in first-order logic, a formal logic, and unlike many other programming languages, Prolog is declarative: the program logic is expressed in terms of relations, represented as facts and rules. A computation is initiated by running a query over these relations.
The language was first conceived by a group around Alain Colmerauer in Marseille, France, in the early 1970s and the first Prolog system was developed in 1972 by Colmerauer with Philippe Roussel.
Prolog was one of the first logic programming languages, and remains the most popular among such languages today, with many free and commercial implementations available. The language has been used for theorem proving, expert systems, as well as its original intended field of use, natural language processing. Modern Prolog environments support creating graphical user interfaces, as well as administrative and networked applications.
Prolog is well-suited for specific tasks that benefit from rule-based logical queries such as databases searching, voice control systems, and template filling.},

@article{actionselection_2015,
  title = {Action Selection},

  abstract = {Action selection is a way of characterizing the most basic problem of intelligent systems: what to do next. In artificial intelligence and computational cognitive science, "the action selection problem" is typically associated with intelligent agents and animats\textemdash{}artificial systems that exhibit complex behaviour in an agent environment. The term is also sometimes used in ethology or animal behavior.
One problem for understanding action selection is determining the level of abstraction used for specifying an "act". At the most basic level of abstraction, an atomic act could be anything from contracting a muscle cell to provoking a war. Typically for any one action-selection mechanism, the set of possible actions is predefined and fixed.
Most researchers working in this field place high demands on their agents:
The acting agent typically must select its action in dynamic and unpredictable environments.
The agents typically act in real time; therefore they must make decisions in a timely fashion.
The agents are normally created to perform several different tasks. These tasks may conflict for resource allocation (e.g. can the agent put out a fire and deliver a cup of coffee at the same time?)
The environment the agents operate in may include humans, who may make things more difficult for the agent (either intentionally or by attempting to assist.)
The agents themselves are often intended to model animals or humans, and animal/human behaviour is quite complicated.
For these reasons action selection is not trivial and attracts a good deal of research.},

  abstract = {Unification, in computer science and logic, is an algorithmic process of solving equations between symbolic expressions.
Depending on which expressions (also called terms) are allowed to occur in an equation set (also called unification problem), and which expressions are considered equal, several frameworks of unification are distinguished. If higher-order variables, that is, variables representing functions, are allowed in an expression, the process is called higher-order unification, otherwise first-order unification. If a solution is required to make both sides of each equation literally equal, the process is called syntactical unification, otherwise semantical, or equational unification, or E-unification, or unification modulo theory.
A solution of a unification problem is denoted as a substitution, that is, a mapping assigning a symbolic value to each variable of the problem's expressions. A unification algorithm should compute for a given problem a complete, and minimal substitution set, that is, a set covering all its solutions, and containing no redundant members. Depending on the framework, a complete and minimal substitution set may have at most one, at most finitely many, or possibly infinitely many members, or may not exist at all. In some frameworks it is generally impossible to decide whether any solution exists. For first-order syntactical unification, Martelli and Montanari gave an algorithm that reports unsolvability or computes a complete and minimal singleton substitution set containing the so-called most general unifier.
For example, using x,y,z as variables, the singleton equation set \{ cons(x,cons(x,nil)) = cons(2,y) \} is a syntactic first-order unification problem that has the substitution \{ x {$\mapsto$} 2, y {$\mapsto$} cons(2,nil) \} as its only solution. The syntactic first-order unification problem \{ y = cons(2,y) \} has no solution over the set of finite terms; however, it has the single solution \{ y {$\mapsto$} cons(2,cons(2,cons(2,...))) \} over the set of infinite trees. The semantic first-order unification problem \{ a{$\cdot$}x = x{$\cdot$}a \} has each substitution of the form \{ x {$\mapsto$} a{$\cdot$}...{$\cdot$}a \} as a solution in a semigroup, i.e. if ({$\cdot$}) is considered associative; the same problem, viewed in an abelian group, where ({$\cdot$}) is considered also commutative, has any substitution at all as a solution. The singleton set \{ a = y(x) \} is a syntactic second-order unification problem, since y is a function variable. One solution is \{ x {$\mapsto$} a, y {$\mapsto$} (identity function) \}; another one is \{ y {$\mapsto$} (constant function mapping each value to a), x {$\mapsto$} (any value) \}.
The first formal investigation of unification can be attributed to John Alan Robinson, who used first-order syntactical unification as a basic building block of his resolution procedure for first-order logic, a great step forward in automated reasoning technology, as it eliminated one source of combinatorial explosion: searching for instantiation of terms. Today, automated reasoning is still the main application area of unification. Syntactical first-order unification is used in logic programming and programming language type system implementation, especially in Hindley\textendash{}Milner based type inference algorithms. Semantic unification is used in SMT solvers and term rewriting algorithms. Higher-order unification is used in proof assistants, for example Isabelle and Twelf, and restricted forms of higher-order unification (higher-order pattern unification) are used in some programming language implementations, such as lambdaProlog, as higher-order patterns are expressive, yet their associated unification procedure retains theoretical properties closer to first-order unification.},

  title = {{Une approche totalement instanci\'ee pour la planification HTN}},
  abstract = {De nombreuses techniques de planification ont \'et\'e d\'evelopp\'ees pour permettre \`a
des syst\`emes autonomes d'agir et de prendre des d\'ecisions en fonction de leurs perceptions de
l'environnement. Parmi ces techniques, la planification HTN (Hierarchical Task Network) est l'une
des techniques les plus utilis\'ees en pratique. Contrairement aux approches classiques de la planifi-
cation, la planification HTN fonctionne par d\'ecomposition r\'ecursive d'une t\^ache complexe en sous
t\^aches jusqu'\`a ce que chaque sous-t\^ache puisse \^etre r\'ealis\'ee par l'ex\'ecution d'une action. Cette vision
hi\'erarchique de la planification permet une repr\'esentation plus riche des probl\`emes de planification tout
en guidant la recherche d'un plan solution et en apportant de la connaissance aux algorithmes sous-
jacents. Dans cet article, nous proposons une nouvelle approche de la planification HTN dans laquelle,
comme en planification classique, nous instancions l'ensemble des op\'erateurs de planification avant
d'effectuer la recherche d'un plan solution. Cette approche a fait ses preuves en planification clas-
sique. Elle est utilis\'ee par la plupart des planificateurs contemporains mais n'a, \`a notre connaissance,
jamais \'et\'e appliqu\'ee dans le cadre de la planification HTN. L'instanciation des op\'erateurs de planifica-
tion est pourtant n\'ecessaire au d\'eveloppement d'heuristiques efficaces et \`a l'encodage de probl\`emes de
planification HTN dans d'autres formalismes tels que SAT ou CSP. Nous pr\'esentons dans la suite de

  abstract = {In recent years, the field of automatic planning has mainly focused on performances and advances in state space planning to improve scalability. That orientation shadows other less efficient ways of planning like Partial Order Planning (POP) that has the advantage to be much more flexible.
    This flexibility allows these planners to take incomplete plans as input and to refine them into an optimized solution for the problem. This paper presents a set of mechanisms, called aLternative Optimization with partiaL pLan Injection Partial Ordered Planning (LOLLIPOP), that adapts the classical POP algorithm. The aim is to obtain a high plan quality while allowing fast online re-planning. Our algorithm builds an operator graph from the domain compilation that gives information on the possible behavior of operators. A safe operator graph is generated at initialization and used as LOLLIPOP's input to reduce the overhead of the initial subgoal backchaining. We prove that the use of these new mechanisms keeps POP sound and complete.},

We aim to discuss some problems in heterogeneous agent cooperation and generic action composition mechanism in this field. This involve to build a brand new information system to target the issue with an adapted architecture and a coherent models.
The composition of usage scenarios could become a real issue since the agents are heterogeneous in nature (human, robot, connected objects), share different properties (probe/ actuator, predictable/unpredictable) and use different type of communications. The current contribution is a part of a global project ASTRO which is an architecture providing communication gateway, unified interaction interfaces and information exchange.
In order to facilitate the scenario composition we use and integrate ontologies in this framework to create a simple and efficient concept map of the field. This work also created a high level action composition model to create complex scenarios from simple atomic computer interactions. We intend our work to become a stable frame to build ontology based systems in advanced home automation and robotics.},

  abstract = {In mathematics, the gradient is a generalization of the usual concept of derivative to functions of several variables. If f(x1, ..., xn) is a differentiable, real-valued function of several variables, its gradient is the vector whose components are the n partial derivatives of f. It is thus a vector-valued function.
Similarly to the usual derivative, the gradient represents the slope of the tangent of the graph of the function. More precisely, the gradient points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the function, and its magnitude is the slope of the graph in that direction. The components of the gradient in coordinates are the coefficients of the variables in the equation of the tangent space to the graph. This characterizing property of the gradient allows it to be defined independently of a choice of coordinate system, as a vector field whose components in a coordinate system will transform when going from one coordinate system to another.
The Jacobian is the generalization of the gradient for vector-valued functions of several variables and differentiable maps between Euclidean spaces or, more generally, manifolds. A further generalization for a function between Banach spaces is the Fr\'echet derivative.},

  abstract = {In mathematical optimization, the method of Lagrange multipliers (named after Joseph Louis Lagrange) is a strategy for finding the local maxima and minima of a function subject to equality constraints.
For instance (see Figure 1), consider the optimization problem
maximize f(x, y)
subject to g(x, y) = 0.
We need both f and g to have continuous first partial derivatives. We introduce a new variable ({$\lambda$}) called a Lagrange multiplier and study the Lagrange function (or Lagrangian) defined by

  
    
      
        
          
            L
          
        
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        ,
        {$\lambda$}
        )

where the {$\lambda$} term may be either added or subtracted. If f(x0, y0) is a maximum of f(x, y) for the original constrained problem, then there exists {$\lambda$}0 such that (x0, y0, {$\lambda$}0) is a stationary point for the Lagrange function (stationary points are those points where the partial derivatives of

    \{\textbackslash{}displaystyle \{\textbackslash{}mathcal \{L\}\}\}

  abstract = {In planning based on hierarchical task networks (HTN), plans are generated by refining high-level actions (`compound tasks') into lower-level actions, until primitive actions are obtained that can be sent to execution. While a primitive action is defined by its precondition and effects, a high-level action is defined by zero, one or several methods: sets of (high-level or primitive) actions decomposing it together with a constraint. We give a semantics of HTNs in terms of dynamic logic with program inclusion. We propose postulates guaranteeing soundness and completeness of action refinement. We also show that hybrid planning can be analysed in the same dynamic logic framework.},

  doi = {10.1007/s10489-016-0865-0},
  abstract = {In this paper, we focus on how to handle disruptions during plan execution. Disruption are common in realistic plan execution, and the replanning is needed when the original plan is failed. Aiming to reduce the number of unnecessary replanning in this situation, a novel heuristic HTN (Hierarchical Task Network) planning approach is proposed. The approach includes two components: F-HTN and Controller. F-HTN is a heuristic temporal HTN planner. F-HTN uses STNs (Simple Temporal Networks) to express the complex temporal constraints in planning, and an STN-based heuristic search is designed to guide the search direction in F-HTN. When the planner F-HTN is terminated, it will generate a flexible plan which includes a complete plan and an STN associated with it. Then, Controller checks and adjusts the flexible plan when a disruption occurs during the plan execution. Integrating the plan generation and plan execution, this approach will reduce the number of unnecessary replanning. In the experimental study, we demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of this approach through some emergency logistics problems.},

  title = {{{HTN Planning Approach Using Fully Instantiated Problems}}},
  abstract = {Many planning techniques have been developed to allow autonomous systems to act and make decisions based on their perceptions of the environment. Among these techniques, HTN Hierarchical Task Network planning is one of the most used in practice. Unlike classical approaches of planning. HTN operates by decomposing task into sub-tasks until each of these sub-tasks can be achieved an action. This hierarchical representation provide a richer representation of planning problems and allows to better guide the plan search and provides more knowledge to the underlying algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new approach of HTN planning in which, as in conventional planning, we instantiate all planning operators before starting the search process. This approach has proven its effectiveness in classical planning and is necessary for the development of effective heuristics and encoding planning problems in other formalism such as CSP or SAT. The instantiation is actually used by most modern planners but has never been applied in an HTN based planning framework. We present in this article a generic instantiation algorithm which implements many simplification techniques to reduce the process complexity inspired from those used in classical planning. Finally we present some results obtained from an experimentation on a range of problems used in the international planning competitions with a modified version of SHOP planner using fully instantiated problems.},

  abstract = {When AI systems interact with humans in the loop, they are often called on to provide explanations for their plans and behavior. Past work on plan explanations primarily involved the AI system explaining the correctness of its plan and the rationale for its decision in terms of its own model. Such soliloquy is wholly inadequate in most realistic scenarios where the humans have domain and task models that differ significantly from that used by the AI system. We posit that the explanations are best studied in light of these differing models. In particular, we show how explanation can be seen as a "model reconciliation problem" (MRP), where the AI system in effect suggests changes to the human's model, so as to make its plan be optimal with respect to that changed human model. We will study the properties of such explanations, present algorithms for automatically computing them, and evaluate the performance of the algorithms.},

  title = {More than a {{Name}}? {{On Implications}} of {{Preconditions}} and {{Effects}} of {{Compound HTN Planning Tasks}}},
  abstract = {There are several formalizations for hierarchical planning. Many of them allow to specify preconditions and effects for compound tasks. They can be used, e.g., to assist during the modeling process by ensuring that the decomposition methods' plans ``implement'' the compound tasks' intended meaning. This is done based on so-called legality criteria that relate these preconditions and effects to the method's plans and pose further restrictions. Despite the variety of expressive hierarchical planning formalisms, most theoretical investigations are only known for standard HTN planning, where compound tasks are just names, i.e., no preconditions or effects can be specified. Thus, up to know, a direct comparison to other hierarchical planning formalisms is hardly possible and fundamental theoretical properties are yet unknown. We therefore investigate the theoretical impact of such preconditions and effects -- depending on the legality criteria known from the literature -- for two of the most basic questions to planning: plan existence and plan verification. It turns out that for all investigated legality criteria, the respective problems are as hard as in the HTN setting and therefore equally expressive.},

In this paper, we present a domain-independent approach that combines a number of planning and interaction components to realize advanced user assistance. Based on a hybrid planning formalism, the components provide facilities including the generation, execution, and repair as well as the presentation and explanation of plans. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by means of a system that aims to assist users in the assembly of their home theater. An empirical evaluation shows the benefit of such a supportive system, in particular for persons with a lack of domain expertise.},

While the corresponding decision problem is known to be polynomial in state-based search (where search nodes are states), it turns out to be intractable in the POCL setting. Since both the currently best-informed heuristics for POCL planning are based on delete relaxation, we hope that our result sheds some new light on the problem of designing heuristics for POCL planning. Based on this result, we developed a new variant of one of these heuristics which incorporates more information of the current partial plan. We evaluate our heuristic on several domains of the early International Planning Competitions and compare it with other POCL heuristics from the literature.},

  title = {On the {{Decidability}} of {{HTN Planning}} with {{Task Insertion}}},
  abstract = {The field of deterministic AI planning can roughly be divided into two approaches - classical state-based planning and hierarchical task network (HTN) planning. The plan existence problem of the former is known to be decidable while it has been proved undecidable for the latter. When extending HTN planning by allowing the unrestricted insertion of tasks and ordering constraints, one obtains a form of planning which is often referred to as ''hybrid planning''.We present a simplified formalization of HTN planning with and without task insertion. We show that the plan existence problem is undecidable for the HTN setting without task insertion and that it becomes decidable when allowing task insertion. In the course of the proof, we obtain an upper complexity bound of EXPSPACE for the plan existence problem for propositional HTN planning with task insertion.},

Studying the dynamic development of language in a group of humans and robots is difficult and requires considerable resource. We therefore conducted a social simulation of a human\textendash{}robot communication network based on a real-world human\textendash{}human network, allowing us to study how the centrality of the robots' owners influences the propagation of words in the network and what influence the number of robots in the network has on achieving a fixation state. Our results show that robots owned by highly connected people have less effect on the dynamics of language than robots owned by less connected people. Highly connected people interact with many others and therefore are more strongly influenced by a greater number of people and their robots. We have found that 11\% of the humans owning a robot is sufficient for the robots to dominate the development of the language resulting in 95\% of the humans using or adopting their words.},

  abstract = {Much research in artificial intelligence is concerned with the development of autonomous agents that can interact effectively with other agents. An important aspect of such agents is the ability to reason about the behaviours of other agents, by constructing models which make predictions about various properties of interest (such as actions, goals, beliefs) of the modelled agents. A variety of modelling approaches now exist which vary widely in their methodology and underlying assumptions, catering to the needs of the different sub-communities within which they were developed and reflecting the different practical uses for which they are intended. The purpose of the present article is to provide a comprehensive survey of the salient modelling methods which can be found in the literature. The article concludes with a discussion of open problems which may form the basis for fruitful future research.},

However, previous research has not empirically investigated whether the perceived autonomy of robots affects their social acceptance. In this study we examined the impact of perceived robot autonomy on realistic threats (threats to human jobs, resources and safety) and identity threats (threats to human identity and distinctiveness), attitude toward robots, and support for robotics research. US based participants watched a video of robots performing various tasks \textendash{} these robots were presented as either autonomous and capable of disregarding human commands or non-autonomous and only capable of following human commands. Participants who watched videos of supposedly autonomous robots perceived robots in general to be significantly more threatening to humans (both realistic and identity threats) than those who watched a video of non-autonomous robots. Furthermore, exposure to autonomous robots evoked stronger negative attitude towards robots in general and more opposition to robotics research than exposure to non-autonomous robots. Both realistic and identity threats mediated the increase in negative attitudes toward robots and opposition to robotics research, although realistic threats were often the stronger mediator of the two. Our findings have practical implications for research on AI and open new questions on the relationship between robot autonomy and their social impact.},

The key construction in their proof is a notion of relational {$\top\top$}-lifting, using stacks of elimination contexts to obtain a Girard-Tait style logical relation.

We propose a model in which a user's context is described by a set of roles and relations. Different configurations of roles and relations correspond to situations within the context. The components of a context model are used to specify processes for observing activity. The ontology for context modeling is derived from both a bottom up system's perspective and a top-down users' perspective. As we define each element, we describe the corresponding components of a process-based software architecture. Using these components, a context is translated into a federation of observational processes. This model leads to an architecture in which reflexive elements are dynamically composed to form federations of processes for observing and predicting the situations that make up a context.},

@article{homoiconicity_2017,
  title = {Homoiconicity},
  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
  abstract = {In computer programming, homoiconicity (from the Greek words homo meaning the same and icon meaning representation) is a property of some programming languages in which the program structure is similar to its syntax, and therefore the program's internal representation can be inferred by reading the text's layout. If a language is homoiconic, it means that the language text has the same structure as its abstract syntax tree (AST) (i.e. the AST and the syntax are isomorphic). This allows all code in the language to be accessed and transformed as data, using the same representation. This property is often summarized saying that the language treats "code as data".
In a homoiconic language, the primary representation of programs is also a data structure in a primitive type of the language itself. This makes metaprogramming easier than in a language without this property, since code can be treated as data: reflection in the language (examining the program's entities at runtime) depends on a single, homogeneous structure, and it does not have to handle several different structures that would appear in a complex syntax. To put that another way, homoiconicity is where a program's source code is written as a basic data structure that the programming language knows how to access.
A typical, commonly cited example is the programming language Lisp, which was created to be easy for lists manipulation and where the structure is given by S-expressions that take the form of nested lists. Lisp programs are written in the form of lists; the result is that the program can access its own functions and procedures while running, and programmatically reprogram itself on the fly. Homoiconic languages typically include full support of syntactic macros allowing the programmer to express program transformations in a concise way. Examples are the programming languages Clojure (a contemporary dialect of Lisp), Rebol (also its successor Red), Refal, and more recently Julia.},

  abstract = {ML ('Meta Language') is a general-purpose functional programming language. It has roots in Lisp, and has been characterized as "Lisp with types". It is known for its use of the polymorphic Hindley\textendash{}Milner type system, which automatically assigns the types of most expressions without requiring explicit type annotations, and ensures type safety \textendash{} there is a formal proof that a well-typed ML program does not cause runtime type errors. ML provides pattern matching for function arguments, garbage collection, imperative programming, call-by-value and currying. It is used heavily in programming language research and is one of the few languages to be completely specified and verified using formal semantics. Its types and pattern matching make it well-suited and commonly used to operate on other formal languages, such as in compiler writing, automated theorem proving and formal verification.},

  title = {Semantics (Computer Science)},
  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
  abstract = {In programming language theory, semantics is the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of programming languages. It does so by evaluating the meaning of syntactically legal strings defined by a specific programming language, showing the computation involved. In such a case that the evaluation would be of syntactically illegal strings, the result would be non-computation. Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program, or an explanation of how the program will execute on a certain platform, hence creating a model of computation.
Formal semantics, for instance, helps to write compilers, better understand what a program is doing and to prove, e.g., that the following if statement

if 1 = 1 then S1 else S2

has the same effect as S1 alone.},

  title = {Metaprogramming},
  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
  abstract = {Metaprogramming is a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat programs as their data. It means that a program can be designed to read, generate, analyse or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running. In some cases, this allows programmers to minimize the number of lines of code to express a solution, thus reducing the development time. It also allows programs greater flexibility to efficiently handle new situations without recompilation.
Metaprogramming can be used to move computations from run-time to compile-time, to generate code using compile time computations, and to enable self-modifying code. The language in which the metaprogram is written is called the metalanguage. The language of the programs that are manipulated is called the attribute-oriented programming language. The ability of a programming language to be its own metalanguage is called reflection or "reflexivity". Reflection is a valuable language feature to facilitate metaprogramming.
Metaprogramming was popular in the 1970s and 1980s using list processing languages such as LISP. LISP hardware machines were popular in the 1980s and enabled applications that could process code. They were frequently used for artificial intelligence applications.},

@article{metasyntax_2018,
  title = {Metasyntax},
  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
  abstract = {A metasyntax describes the allowable structure and composition of phrases and sentences of a metalanguage, which is used to describe either a natural language or a computer programming language. Some of the widely used formal metalanguages for computer languages are Backus\textendash{}Naur form (BNF), extended Backus\textendash{}Naur form (EBNF), Wirth syntax notation (WSN), and augmented Backus\textendash{}Naur form (ABNF).
These metalanguages have their own metasyntax each composed of terminal symbols, nonterminal symbols, and metasymbols. A terminal symbol, such as a word or a token, is a stand-alone structure in a language being defined. A nonterminal symbol represents a syntactic category, which defines one or more valid phrasal or sentence structure consisted of an n-element subset. Metasymbols provide syntactic information for denotational purposes in a given metasyntax. Terminals, nonterminals, and metasymbols do not apply across all metalanguages.
Typically, the metalanguage for token-level languages (formally called ``regular languages'') does not have nonterminals because nesting is not an issue in these regular languages. English, as a metalanguage for describing certain languages, does not contain metasymbols since all explanation could be done using English expression. There are only certain formal metalanguages used for describing recursive languages (formally called context-free languages) that have terminals, nonterminals, and metasymbols in their metasyntax.},

  abstract = {We present a technique for automatically extracting mutual exclusion invariants from temporal planning instances. It first identifies a set of invariant templates by inspecting the lifted representation of the domain and then checks these templates against properties that assure invariance. Our technique builds on other approaches to invariant synthesis presented in the literature but departs from their limited focus on instantaneous actions by addressing temporal domains. To deal with time, we formulate invariance conditions that account for the entire temporal structure of the actions and the possible concurrent interactions between them. As a result, we construct a more comprehensive technique than previous methods, which is able to find not only invariants for temporal domains but also a broader set of invariants for sequential domains. Our experimental results provide evidence that our domain analysis is effective at identifying a more extensive set of invariants, which results in the generation of fewer multi-valued state variables. We show that, in turn, this reduction in the number of variables reflects positively on the performance of the temporal planners that use a variable/value representation.},

e = the natural logarithm base (also known as Euler's number),
x0 = the x-value of the sigmoid's midpoint,
L = the curve's maximum value, and
k = the steepness of the curve.
For values of x in the domain of real numbers from -{$\infty$} to +{$\infty$}, the S-curve shown on the right is obtained (with the graph of f approaching L as x approaches +{$\infty$} and approaching zero as x approaches -{$\infty$}).
The function was named in 1844\textendash{}1845 by Pierre Fran{\c c}ois Verhulst, who studied it in relation to population growth. The initial stage of growth is approximately exponential; then, as saturation begins, the growth slows, and at maturity, growth stops.
The logistic function finds applications in a range of fields, including artificial neural networks, biology (especially ecology), biomathematics, chemistry, demography, economics, geoscience, mathematical psychology, probability, sociology, political science, linguistics, and statistics.},

where pi is the probability of state i, {$\epsilon$}i the energy of state i, k the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature of the system, and M is the number of states accessible to the system. The sum is over all states accessible to the system of interest. The term system here has a very wide meaning; it can range from a single atom to a macroscopic system such as a natural gas storage tank. Because of this the Boltzmann distribution can be used to solve a very wide variety of problems. The distribution shows that states with lower energy will always have a higher probability of being occupied than the states with higher energy.
The ratio of a Boltzmann distribution computed for two states is known as the Boltzmann factor and characteristically only depends on the states' energy difference.

The Boltzmann distribution is named after Ludwig Boltzmann who first formulated it in 1868 during his studies of the statistical mechanics of gases in thermal equilibrium. Boltzmann's statistical work is borne out in his paper ``On the Relationship between the Second Fundamental Theorem of the Mechanical Theory of Heat and Probability Calculations Regarding the Conditions for Thermal Equilibrium" The distribution was later investigated extensively, in its modern generic form, by Josiah Willard Gibbs in 1902.
The Boltzmann distribution should not be confused with the Maxwell\textendash{}Boltzmann distribution. The former gives the probability that a system will be in a certain state as a function of that state's energy; in contrast, the latter is used to describe particle speeds in idealized gases.},

  abstract = {In recent years the ubiquity of artificial intelligence raised concerns among the uninitiated. The misunderstanding is further increased since most advances do not have explainable results. For automated planning, the research often targets speed, quality, or expressivity. Most existing solutions focus on one area while not addressing the others. However, human-related applications require a complex combination of all those criteria at different levels. We present a new method to compromise on these aspects staying explainable. We aim to leave the range of potential applications as wide as possible but our main targets are human intent recognition and assistive robotics. The HEART planner is a real-time decompositional planner based on a hierarchical version of Partial Order Causal Link (POCL). It cyclically explores the plan space while making sure that intermediary high level plans are valid and will return them as approximate solutions when interrupted. This paper aims to evaluate that process and its results related to classical approaches in terms of efficiency and quality.},

  abstract = {The problem of achieving conjunctive goals has been central to domain-independent planning research; the nonlinear constraint-posting approach has been most successful. Previous planners of this type have been complicated, heuristic, and ill-defined. I have combined and distilled the state of the art into a simple, precise, implemented algorithm (TWEAK) which I have proved correct and complete. I analyze previous work on domain-independent conjunctive planning; in retrospect it becomes clear that all conjunctive planners, linear and nonlinear, work the same way. The efficiency and correctness of these planners depends on the traditional add/delete-list representation for actions, which drastically limits their usefulness. I present theorems that suggest that efficient general purpose planning with more expressive action representations is impossible, and suggest ways to avoid this problem.},

  abstract = {Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning is a practical and efficient approach to planning when the 'standard operating procedures' for a domain are available. Like Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent reasoning, HTN planning performs hierarchical and context-based refinement of goals into subgoals and basic actions. However, while HTN planners 'lookahead' over the consequences of choosing one refinement over another, BDI agents interleave refinement with acting. There has been renewed interest in making HTN planners behave more like BDI agent systems, e.g. to have a unified representation for acting and planning. However, past work on the subject has remained informal or implementation-focused. This paper is a formal account of 'HTN acting', which supports interleaved deliberation, acting, and failure recovery. We use the syntax of the most general HTN planning formalism and build on its core semantics, and we provide an algorithm which combines our new formalism with the processing of exogenous events. We also study the properties of HTN acting and its relation to HTN planning.},

of new modelling languages, as well as extensions of existing ones, are proposed every year. We may consider that a modelling
language is useful if it allows to represent the critical aspects of systems in an expressive way. In particular, we require that the modelling language allows to accurately discriminate
between correct and incorrect behaviors concerning critical aspects of the model. In this paper we present a method to assess the suitability of a modelling
language to define systems belonging to a specific domain. Basically, given a system, we consider alternative correct/incorrect
systems and we study whether the representations provided by the studied modelling language keep the distinction between correct
and incorrect as each alternative system does.},

@article{knowledgebase_2018,
  title = {Knowledge Base},
  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
  abstract = {A knowledge base (KB) is a technology used to store complex structured and unstructured information used by a computer system. The initial use of the term was in connection with expert systems which were the first knowledge-based systems.
The original use of the term knowledge-base was to describe one of the two sub-systems of a knowledge-based system. A knowledge-based system consists of a knowledge-base that represents facts about the world and an inference engine that can reason about those facts and use rules and other forms of logic to deduce new facts or highlight inconsistencies.The term "knowledge-base" was coined to distinguish this form of knowledge store from the more common and widely used term database. At the time (the 1970s) virtually all large Management Information Systems stored their data in some type of hierarchical or relational database. At this point in the history of Information Technology the distinction between a database and a knowledge base was clear and unambiguous. A database had these properties:

Flat data. Data was usually represented in a tabular format with strings or numbers in each field.
Multiple users. A conventional database needed to support more than one user or system logged into the same data at the same time.
Transactions. An essential requirement for a database was to maintain integrity and consistency among data accessed by concurrent users. These are the so-called ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
Large, long-lived data. A corporate database needed to support not just thousands but hundreds of thousands or more rows of data. Such a database usually needed to persist past the specific uses of any individual program; it needed to store data for years and decades rather than for the life of a program.The first knowledge-based systems had data needs that were the opposite of these database requirements. An expert system requires structured data. Not just tables with numbers and strings, but pointers to other objects that in turn have additional pointers. The ideal representation for a knowledge base is an object model (often called an ontology in artificial intelligence literature) with classes, subclasses and instances.
Early expert systems also had little need for multiple users or the complexity that comes with requiring transactional properties on data. The data for the early expert systems was used to arrive at a specific answer, such as a medical diagnosis, the design of a molecule, or a response to an emergency. Once the solution to the problem was known there was not a critical demand to store large amounts of data back to a permanent memory store. A more precise statement would be that given the technologies available researchers compromised and did without these capabilities because they realized they were beyond what could be expected and they could develop useful solutions to non-trivial problems without them. Even from the beginning the more astute researchers realized the potential benefits of being able to store, analyze, and reuse knowledge. For example, see the discussion of Corporate Memory in the earliest work of the Knowledge-Based Software Assistant program by Cordell Green et al.The volume requirements were also different for a knowledge-base compared to a conventional database. The knowledge-base needed to know facts about the world.  For example, to represent the statement that "All humans are mortal". A database typically could not represent this general knowledge but instead would need to store information about thousands of tables that represented information about specific humans. Representing that all humans are mortal and being able to reason about any given human that they are mortal is the work of a knowledge-base. Representing that George, Mary, Sam, Jenna, Mike,... and hundreds of thousands of other customers are all humans with specific ages, sex, address, etc. is the work for a database.As expert systems moved from being prototypes to systems deployed in corporate environments the requirements for their data storage rapidly started to overlap with the standard database requirements for multiple, distributed users with support for transactions. Initially, the demand could be seen in two different but competitive markets. From the AI and Object-Oriented communities object-oriented databases such as Versant emerged. These were systems designed from the ground up to have support for object-oriented capabilities but also to support standard database services as well. On the other hand, the large database vendors such as Oracle added capabilities to their products that provided support for knowledge-base requirements such as class-subclass relations and rules.
The next evolution for the term knowledge-base was the Internet. With the rise of the Internet, documents, hypertext, and multimedia support were now critical for any corporate database. It was no longer enough to support large tables of data or relatively small objects that lived primarily in computer memory. Support for corporate web sites required persistence and transactions for documents. This created a whole new discipline known as Web Content Management. The other driver for document support was the rise of knowledge management vendors such as Lotus Notes. Knowledge Management actually predated the Internet but with the Internet there was great synergy between the two areas. Knowledge management products adopted the term "knowledge-base" to describe their repositories but the meaning had a subtle difference. In the case of previous knowledge-based systems the knowledge was primarily for the use of an automated system, to reason about and draw conclusions about the world. With knowledge management products the knowledge was primarily meant for humans, for example to serve as a repository of manuals, procedures, policies, best practices, reusable designs and code, etc.  In both cases the distinctions between the uses and kinds of systems were ill-defined. As the technology scaled up it was rare to find a system that could really be cleanly classified as knowledge-based in the sense of an expert system that performed automated reasoning and knowledge-based in the sense of knowledge management that provided knowledge in the form of documents and media that could be leveraged by us humans.},

  abstract = {In mathematics, logic, and computer science, a type theory is any of a class of formal systems, some of which can serve as alternatives to set theory as a foundation for all mathematics. In type theory, every "term" has a "type" and operations are restricted to terms of a certain type.
Type theory is closely related to (and in some cases overlaps with) type systems, which are a programming language feature used to reduce bugs. Type theory was created to avoid paradoxes in a variety of formal logics and rewrite systems.
Two well-known type theories that can serve as mathematical foundations are Alonzo Church's typed {$\lambda$}-calculus and Per Martin-L\"of's intuitionistic type theory.},

  title = {First-Order Logic},
  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
  abstract = {First-order logic\textemdash{}also known as first-order predicate calculus and predicate logic\textemdash{}is a collection of formal systems used in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as Socrates is a man one can have expressions in the form "there exists X such that X is Socrates and X is a man" and there exists is a quantifier while X is a variable. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers or relations.A theory about a topic is usually a first-order logic together with a specified domain of discourse over which the quantified variables range, finitely many functions from that domain to itself, finitely many predicates defined on that domain, and a set of axioms believed to hold for those things. Sometimes "theory" is understood in a more formal sense, which is just a set of sentences in first-order logic.
The adjective "first-order" distinguishes first-order logic from higher-order logic in which there are predicates having predicates or functions as arguments, or in which one or both of predicate quantifiers or function quantifiers are permitted. In first-order theories, predicates are often associated with sets. In interpreted higher-order theories, predicates may be interpreted as sets of sets.
There are many deductive systems for first-order logic which are both sound (all provable statements are true in all models) and complete (all statements which are true in all models are provable). Although the logical consequence relation is only semidecidable, much progress has been made in automated theorem proving in first-order logic. First-order logic also satisfies several metalogical theorems that make it amenable to analysis in proof theory, such as the L\"owenheim\textendash{}Skolem theorem and the compactness theorem.
First-order logic is the standard for the formalization of mathematics into axioms and is studied in the foundations of mathematics.
Peano arithmetic and Zermelo\textendash{}Fraenkel set theory are axiomatizations of number theory and set theory, respectively, into first-order logic.
No first-order theory, however, has the strength to uniquely describe  a structure with an infinite domain, such as the natural numbers or the real line. Axioms systems that do fully describe these two structures (that is, categorical axiom systems) can be obtained in stronger logics such as second-order logic.
The foundations of first-order logic were developed independently by Gottlob Frege and Charles Sanders Peirce. For a history of first-order logic and how it came to dominate formal logic, see Jos\'e Ferreir\'os (2001).},

@article{compiler_2018,
  title = {Compiler},
  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
  abstract = {A compiler is computer software that transforms computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another programming language (the target language). Compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers. The name compiler is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an executable program.However, there are many different types of compilers. If the compiled program can run on a computer whose CPU or operating system is different from the one on which the compiler runs, the compiler is a cross-compiler. A bootstrap compiler is written in the language that it intends to compile. A program that translates from a low-level language to a higher level one is a decompiler. A program that translates between high-level languages is usually called a source-to-source compiler or transpiler. A language rewriter is usually a program that translates the form of expressions without a change of language. The term compiler-compiler refers to tools used to create parsers that perform syntax analysis.
A compiler is likely to perform many or all of the following operations: preprocessing, lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis (syntax-directed translation), conversion of input programs to an intermediate representation, code optimization and code generation. Compilers implement these operations in phases that promote efficient design and correct transformations of source input to target output. Program faults caused by incorrect compiler behavior can be very difficult to track down and work around; therefore, compiler implementers invest significant effort to ensure compiler correctness.Compilers are not the only translators used to transform source programs. An interpreter is computer software that transforms and then executes the indicated operations. The translation process influences the design of computer languages which leads to a preference of compilation or interpretation. In practice, an interpreter can be implemented for compiled languages and compilers can be implemented for interpreted languages.},

  abstract = {The use of different modeling languages in software development makes their integration a must. Most existing integration approaches are metamodel-based with these metamodels representing both an abstract syntax of the corresponding modeling language and also a data structure for storing models. This implementation specific focus, however, does not make explicit certain language concepts, which can complicate integration tasks. Hence, we propose a process which semi-automatically lifts metamodels into ontologies by making implicit concepts in the metamodel explicit in the ontology. Thus, a shift of focus from the implementation of a certain modeling language towards the explicit reification of the concepts covered by this language is made. This allows matching on a solely conceptual level, which helps to achieve better results in terms of mappings that can in turn be a basis for deriving implementation specific transformation code.},

  title = {A Classification and Comparison Framework for Software Architecture Description Languages},
  volume = {26},
  abstract = {Software architectures shift the focus of developers from lines-of-code to coarser-grained architectural elements and their overall interconnection structure. Architecture description languages (ADLs) have been proposed as modeling notations to support architecture-based development. There is, however, little consensus in the research community on what is an ADL, what aspects of an architecture should be modeled in an ADL, and which of several possible ADLs is best suited for a particular problem. Furthermore, the distinction is rarely made between ADLs on one hand and formal specification, module interconnection, simulation, and programming languages on the other. This paper attempts to provide an answer to these questions. It motivates and presents a definition and a classification framework for ADLs. The utility of the definition is demonstrated by using it to differentiate ADLs from other modeling notations. The framework is used to classify and compare several existing ADLs, enabling us in the process to identify key properties of ADLs. The comparison highlights areas where existing ADLs provide extensive support and those in which they are deficient, suggesting a research agenda for the future.},

The general notion of nonmonotonic reasoning, though, has almost always been described  only negatively, by the property it does not enjoy, i.e. monotonicity. We study here general patterns of  nonmonotonic reasoning and try to isolate properties that could help us map the field of nonmonotonic  reasoning by reference to positive properties. We concentrate on a number of families of nonmonotonic  consequence relations, defined in the style of Gentzen [13]. Both proof-theoretic and semantic points  of view are developed in parallel. The former point of view was pioneered by D. Gabbay in [10], while  the latter has been advocated by Y. Shoham in [38]. Five such families are defined and characterized  by representation theorems, relating the two points of view. One of the families of interest, that of  preferential relations, turns out to have been studied by E. Adams in [2]. The pr...},

  abstract = {Knowledge representation and engineering techniques are becoming useful and popular components of hybrid integrated systems used to solve complicated practical problems in different disciplines. These techniques offer features such as: learning from experience, handling noisy and incomplete data, helping with decision making, and predicting capabilities. In this paper, we present a multi-domain knowledge representation structure called Decisional DNA that can be implemented and shared for the exploitation of embedded knowledge in multiple technologies. Decisional DNA, as a knowledge representation structure, offers great possibilities on gathering explicit knowledge of formal decision events as well as a tool for decision making processes. Its applicability is shown in this paper when applied to different decisional technologies. The main advantages of using the Decisional DNA rely on: (i) versatility and dynamicity of the knowledge structure, (ii) storage of day-to-day explicit experience in a single structure, (iii) transportability and shareability of the knowledge, and (iv) predicting capabilities based on the collected experience. Thus, after analysis and results, we conclude that the Decisional DNA, as a unique multi-domain structure, can be applied and shared among multiple technologies while enhancing them with predicting capabilities and facilitating knowledge engineering processes inside decision making systems.},

The W3C standard OWL defines one of the most important ontology languages based on the semantics of description logics. An alternative is to use rule languages in knowledge modelling, as proposed in the W3C's RIF standard. So far, it has often been unclear how to combine both technologies without sacrificing essential computational properties. This book explains this problem and presents new solutions that have recently been proposed. Extensive introductory chapters provide the necessary background for understanding the goals and challenges of this field, whereas advanced chapters discuss novel solutions in full detail. Enriched knowledge representation languages that are introduced include DL Rules, Horn description logics, and DL+safe Rules. In each of these cases, emphasis is put on finding a favourable trade-off between expressiveness and computational complexity. This naturally leads to the light-weight DL rule language ELP which illustrates that expressive ontological modelling and tractable inferencing can indeed go together.

  abstract = {Complex engineering problems are typically solved by running a batch of software programs. Data exchange between these software programs is frequently based on semi-structured text files. These files are edited by text editors providing basic input support, however without proper input validation prior program execution. Consequently, even minor lexical or syntactic errors cause software programs to stop without delivering a result. To tackle these problems a more specific editor support, which is aware of language concepts of data exchange files, needs to be provided. In this paper, we investigate if and in what quality a language grammar can be inferred from a set of existing text files, in order to provide a basis for the desired editing support. For this experiment, we chose a Minimal Adequate Teacher (MAT) method together with specific preprocessing of the existing text files. Thereby, we were able to construct complete grammar rules for most of the language constructs found in a corpus of semi-structured text files. The inferred grammar, however, requires refactoring towards a suitable and maintainable basis for the desired editor support.},

The model deals with a learning process in which an algorithm is given an input of a large set of training sentences that belong to some unknown grammar. The algorithm then tries to infer this grammar. Our model is based on the well-known Minimum Description Length Principle. It is quite close to, but more general than several other existing approaches. We have shown that one of these approaches (based on n-gram statistics) coincides exactly with a restricted version of our own model. We have used a restricted version of the algorithm implied by the model to find classes of related words in natural language texts. It turns out that for this task, which can be seen as a `degenerate' case of grammar learning, our approach gives quite good results. As opposed to many other approaches, it also provides a clear `stopping criterion' indicating at what point the learning process should stop.},

Exploiting the approximation structure of a model for the untyped language of terms, types are interpreted as limits of sequences of their approximations. We show that the interpretation is essentially unique and that two types have equal interpretation if and only if their infinite unfoldings are identical.

The notion of ontologies is crucial for the purpose of enabling knowledge sharing and reuse. The Handbook on Ontologies provides a comprehensive overview of the current status and future prospectives of the field of ontologies considering ontology languages, ontology engineering methods, example ontologies, infrastructures and technologies for ontologies, and how to bring this all into ontology-based infrastructures and applications that are among the best of their kind. The field of ontologies has tremendously developed and grown in the five years since the first edition of the "Handbook on Ontologies". Therefore, its revision includes 21 completely new chapters as well as a major re-working of 15 chapters transferred to this second edition.},

  abstract = {Watching the evolution of the Semantic Web (SW) from its inception to these days we can easily observe that the main task the developers face while building it is to encode the human knowledge into ontologies and the human reasoning into dedicated reasoning engines. Now, the SW needs to have efficient mechanisms to access information by both humans and artificial agents. The most important tools in this context are ontologies. The last years have been dedicated to solving the infrastructure problems related to ontologies: ontology management, ontology matching, ontology adoption, but as time goes by and these problems are better understood the research interests in this area will surely shift towards the way in which agents will use them to communicate between them and with humans. Despite the fact that interface agents could be bilingual, it would be more efficient, safe and swift that they should use the same language to communicate with humans and with their peers. Since anthropocentric systems entail nowadays multimodal interfaces, it seems suitable to build multimodal ontologies. Generic ontologies are needed when dealing with uncertainty. Multimodal ontologies should be designed taking into account our way of thinking (mind maps, visual thinking, feedback, logic, emotions, etc.) and also the processes in which they would be involved (multimodal fusion and integration, error reduction, natural language processing, multimodal fission, etc.). By doing this it would be easier for us (and also fun) to use ontologies, but in the same time the communication with agents (and also agent to agent talk) would be enhanced. This is just one of our conclusions related to why building generic multimodal ontologies is very important for future semantic web applications.},

Ironically, when RDF was standardized by W3C over three years ago [24], it came without a semantics. There is now growing understanding that a Semantic Web language without a semantics is an oxymoron, and a number of efforts are directed towards giving RDF a precise semantics [17,15,11]. In this paper we propose a simple semantics for anonymous resources and meta statements in F-logic [23] \textendash{} a frame-based logic language, which is a popular formalism for representing and reasoning about semantic information on the Web [29,14,16,13,12].The choice of F-logic (over RDF) as a basis for our semantics is motivated by the fact that F-logic provides a comprehensive solution for the problem of integrating frames, rules, inheritance, and deduction, and it has been shown to provide an effective inference service for RDF [13,28].},

However, it is not usual to find practical studies about what the real interest of these techniques is, and which approaches are better adapted in each case.We justify the consideration of dynamic programming, both in definite clause and context-free grammar parsing, highlighting the parallelism between the conclusions reached in both cases.

Four characteristics of knowledge, namely particularity, specificity, bipolarity, and orthogonality, are identified. They form the components of a multidimensional knowledge structure that constitutes a static spatial organization of knowledge. These components are related together through multiple levels of details and multiple system views. The proposed structure creates a taxonomy for classifying knowledge. It brings chaos to order by giving meanings to the phenomenon of diverse opinions on knowledge.},

The current research on ontology mapping and ontology translation mainly focuses on how to map and translate the vocabularies and associated data instances from one ontology to another. However, when extending one ontology using axioms from another, we must confront the problem of translating axioms. In this paper, we show that simple symbol replacement will not solve the problem of axiom translation because of asymmetry of translation. Instead we extend our inferential ontology translation for facts (ground atomic formulas) and queries to cover axioms using a method we call axiom derivation.},

We provide a formal semantics for pddl+ by mapping planning instances into constructs of hybrid automata. Using the syntax of HAs as our semantic model we construct a semantic mapping to labelled transition systems to complete the formal interpretation of pddl+ planning instances. An advantage of building a mapping from pddl+ to HA theory is that it forms a bridge between the Planning and Real Time Systems research communities. One consequence is that we can expect to make use of some of the theoretical properties of HAs. For example, for a restricted class of HAs the Reachability problem (which is equivalent to Plan Existence) is decidable. pddl+ provides an alternative to the continuous durative action model of pddl2.1, adding a more flexible and robust model of time-dependent behaviour.},

  title = {{{HATP}}: {{An HTN Planner}} for {{Robotics}}},
  shorttitle = {{{HATP}}},
  abstract = {Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning is a popular approach that cuts down
on the classical planning search space by relying on a given hierarchical
library of domain control knowledge. This provides an intuitive methodology for
specifying high-level instructions on how robots and agents should perform
tasks, while also giving the planner enough flexibility to choose the
lower-level steps and their ordering. In this paper we present the HATP
(Hierarchical Agent-based Task Planner) planning framework which extends the
traditional HTN planning domain representation and semantics by making them
more suitable for roboticists, and treating agents as "first class" entities in
the language. The former is achieved by allowing "social rules" to be defined
which specify what behaviour is acceptable/unacceptable by the agents/robots in

  title = {An {{Overview}} of {{Hierarchical Task Network Planning}}},
  abstract = {Hierarchies are the most common structure used to understand the world
better. In galaxies, for instance, multiple-star systems are organised in a
hierarchical system. Then, governmental and company organisations are
structured using a hierarchy, while the Internet, which is used on a daily
basis, has a space of domain names arranged hierarchically. Since Artificial
Intelligence (AI) planning portrays information about the world and reasons to
solve some of world's problems, Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning has
been introduced almost 40 years ago to represent and deal with hierarchies. Its
requirement for rich domain knowledge to characterise the world enables HTN
planning to be very useful, but also to perform well. However, the history of
almost 40 years obfuscates the current understanding of HTN planning in terms
of accomplishments, planning models, similarities and differences among
hierarchical planners, and its current and objective image. On top of these
issues, attention attracts the ability of hierarchical planning to truly cope
with the requirements of applications from the real world. We propose a
framework-based approach to remedy this situation. First, we provide a basis
for defining different formal models of hierarchical planning, and define two
models that comprise a large portion of HTN planners. Second, we provide a set
of concepts that helps to interpret HTN planners from the aspect of their
search space. Then, we analyse and compare the planners based on a variety of
properties organised in five segments, namely domain authoring, expressiveness,
competence, performance and applicability. Furthermore, we select Web service
composition as a real-world and current application, and classify and compare
the approaches that employ HTN planning to solve the problem of service
composition. Finally, we conclude with our findings and present directions for
future work},

Although planning is one of the oldest researched areas in Artificial Intelligence and attempts have been made in the past at developing task ontologies for planning, these formalizations suffer from serious limitations: they do not exhibit the required level of formalization and precision and they usually fail to include some of the key concepts required for specifying planning problems. In contrast with earlier proposals, our task ontology formalizes the nature of the planning task independently of any planning paradigm, specific domains, or applications and provides a fine-grained, precise and comprehensive characterization of the space of planning problems. Finally, in addition to producing a formal specification we have also operationalized the ontology into a set of executable definitions, which provide a concrete reusable resource for knowledge acquisition and system development in planning applications.},

This paper proposed a dynamic Web service composition framework which based on OWL-S and HTN planning. It uses OWL-S as Web service description language and HTN planning engine to calculate service execution sequence dynamically. Under this framework, we firstly develop a service integration algorithm based on an improved K-Means algorithm. Based on the proposed service integration algorithm, we design a two-stage service match algorithm, which reduce the time cost of service match making with a large number of services. In particular, our HTN planning approach is based on several service types, not all the service instances, which greatly improve the efficiency of the planning procedure.},

  title = {Learning {{HTN Method Preconditions}} and {{Action Models}} from {{Partial Observations}}},
  abstract = {To apply hierarchical task network (HTN) planning to real-world planning problems, one needs to encode the HTN schemata and action models beforehand. However, acquiring such domain knowledge is difficult and time-consuming because the HTN domain definition involves a significant knowledge-engineering effort. A system that can learn the HTN planning domain knowledge automatically would save time and allow HTN planning to be used in domains where such knowledgeengineering effort is not feasible. In this paper, we present a formal framework and algorithms to acquire HTN planning domain knowledge, by learning the preconditions and effects of actions and preconditions of methods. Our algorithm, HTNlearner, first builds constraints from given observed decomposition trees to build action models and method preconditions. It then solves these constraints using a weighted MAX-SAT solver. The solution can be converted to action models and method preconditions. Unlike prior work on HTN learning, we do not depend on complete action models or state information. We test the algorithm on several domains, and show that our HTN-learner algorithm is both effective and efficient.},

@article{lambdacube_2018,
  title = {Lambda Cube},
  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
  abstract = {In mathematical logic and type theory, the {$\lambda$}-cube is a framework for exploring the axes of refinement in Thierry Coquand's calculus of constructions, starting from the simply typed lambda calculus (written as {$\lambda\rightarrow$} in the cube diagram) as the vertex of a cube placed at the origin, and the calculus of constructions (higher-order dependently typed polymorphic lambda calculus; written as {$\lambda$}P{$\omega$} in the diagram) as its diametrically opposite vertex.  Each axis of the cube represents a new form of abstraction:

Values depending on types, or polymorphism. System F, also known as second-order lambda calculus (written as {$\lambda$}2 in the diagram), is obtained by imposing only this property.
Types depending on types, or type operators. Simply typed lambda calculus with type operators ({$\lambda\omega$} in the diagram) is obtained by imposing only this property. Combined with System F it yields System F{$\omega$} (written as {$\lambda\omega$} without the underline in the diagram).
Types depending on values, or dependent types. Imposing only this property yields {$\lambda\Pi$} (written as {$\lambda$}P in the diagram), a type system closely related to LF.All eight calculi include the most basic form of abstraction, values depending on values, ordinary functions as in the simply typed lambda calculus. The richest calculus in the cube, with all three abstractions, is the calculus of constructions. All eight calculi are strongly normalizing.
Subtyping however is not represented in the cube, even though systems like 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            {$<$}:
          
          
            {$\omega$}
          
        
      
    
    \{\textbackslash{}displaystyle F\_\{{$<$}:\}\^\{\textbackslash{}omega \}\}
  , known as higher-order bounded quantification, which combines subtyping and polymorphism are of practical interest, and can be further generalized to bounded type operators. Further extensions to 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            {$<$}:
          
          
            {$\omega$}
          
        
      
    
    \{\textbackslash{}displaystyle F\_\{{$<$}:\}\^\{\textbackslash{}omega \}\}
   allow the definition of purely functional objects; these systems were generally developed after the lambda cube paper was published.The idea of the cube is due to the mathematician Henk Barendregt (1991). The framework of pure type systems generalizes the lambda cube in the sense that all corners of the cube, as well as many other systems can be represented as instances of this general framework. This framework predates the lambda cube by a couple of years. In his 1991 paper, Barendregt also defines the corners of the cube in this framework.
In his Habilitation \`a diriger les recherches Lambda-Prolog de A \`a Z... ou presque [1], Olivier Ridoux gives a cut-out template of the Lambda cube (p. 70) and also a dual representation of the cube as an octahedron, where the 8 vertices are replaced by faces, as well as a dual representation as a dodecahedron, where the 12 edges are replaced by faces.},

@article{puretypesystem_2017,
  title = {Pure Type System},
  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
  abstract = {In the branches of mathematical logic known as proof theory and type theory, a pure type system (PTS), previously known as a generalized type system (GTS), is a form of typed lambda calculus that allows an arbitrary number of sorts and dependencies between any of these. The framework can be seen as a generalisation of Barendregt's lambda cube, in the sense that all corners of the cube can be represented as instances of a PTS with just two sorts. In fact Barendregt (1991) framed his cube in this setting. Pure type systems may obscure the distinction between types and terms and collapse the type hierarchy, as is the case with the calculus of constructions, but this is not generally the case, e.g. the simply typed lambda calculus allows only terms to depend on terms.
Pure type systems were independently introduced by Stefano Berardi (1988) and Jan Terlouw (1989). Barendregt discussed them at length in his subsequent papers. In his PhD thesis, Berardi defined a cube of constructive logics akin to the lambda cube (these specifications are non-dependent). A modification of this cube was later called the L-cube by Geuvers, who in his PhD thesis extended the Curry\textendash{}Howard correspondence to this setting. Based on these ideas, Barthe and others defined classical pure type systems (CPTS) by adding a double negation operator.    	
Similarly, in 1998, Tijn Borghuis introduced modal pure type systems (MPTS). Roorda has discussed the application of pure type systems to functional programming; and Roorda and Jeuring have proposed a programming language based on pure type systems.The systems from the lambda cube are all known to be strongly normalizing. Pure type systems in general need not be, for example System U from Girard's paradox is not. (Roughly speaking, Girard found pure systems in which one can express the sentence "the types form a type".) Furthermore, all known examples of pure type systems that are not strongly normalizing are not even (weakly) normalizing: they contain expressions that do not have normal forms, just like the untyped lambda calculus. It is a major open problem in the field whether this is always the case, i.e. whether a (weakly) normalizing PTS always has the strong normalization property. This is known as the Barendregt\textendash{}Geuvers\textendash{}Klop conjecture (named after Henk Barendregt, Herman Geuvers, and Jan Willem Klop).},

@phdthesis{papoulias_remote_2013,
  title = {Remote {{Debugging}} and {{Reflection}} in {{Resource Constrained Devices}}},
  abstract = {Building software for devices that cannot locally support development tools can be challenging. These devices have either limited computing power to run an IDE (e.g., smart-phones), lack appropriate input/output interfaces (display, keyboard, mouse) for programming (e.g., mobile robots) or are simply unreachable for local development (e.g., cloud-servers). In these situations developers need appropriate infrastructure to remotely develop and debug applications. Yet remote debugging solutions can prove awkward to use due to their distributed nature. Empirical studies show us that on average 10.5 minutes per coding hour (over five 40-hour work weeks per year) are spend for re-deploying applications while fixing bugs or improving functionality [ZeroTurnAround 2011]. Moreover current solutions lack facilities that would otherwise be available in a local setting because its difficult to reproduce them remotely (e.g., object-centric debugging [Ressia 2012b]). This fact can impact the amount of experimentation during a remote debugging session - compared to a local setting. In this dissertation in order to overcome these issues we first identify four desirable properties that an ideal solution for remote debugging should exhibit, namely: interactiveness, instrumentation, distribution and security. Interactiveness is the ability of a remote debugging solution to incrementally update all parts of a remote application without losing the running context (i.e., without stopping the application). Instrumentation is the ability of a debugging solution to alter the semantics of a running process in order to assist debugging. Distribution is the ability of a debugging solution to adapt its framework while debugging a remote target. Finally security refers to the availability of prerequisites for authentication and access restriction. Given these properties we propose Mercury, a remote debugging model and architecture for reflective OO languages. Mercury supports interactiveness through a mirror-based remote meta-level that is causally connected to its target, instrumentation through reflective intercession by reifying the underlying execution environment, distribution through an adaptable middleware and security by decomposing and authenticating access to reflective facilities. We validate our proposal through a prototype implementation in the Pharo programming language using a diverse experimental setting of multiple constraint devices. We exemplify remote debugging techniques supported by Mercury's properties, such as remote agile debugging and remote object instrumentation and show how these can solve in practice the problems we have identified.},

While graph edges are pairs of nodes, hyperedges are arbitrary sets of nodes, and can therefore contain an arbitrary number of nodes. However, it is often desirable to study hypergraphs where all hyperedges have the same cardinality; a k-uniform hypergraph is a hypergraph such that all its hyperedges have size k. (In other words, one such hypergraph is a collection of sets, each such set a hyperedge connecting k nodes.) So a 2-uniform hypergraph is a graph, a 3-uniform hypergraph is a collection of unordered triples, and so on.
A hypergraph is also called a set system or a family of sets drawn from the universal set X. The difference between a set system and a hypergraph is in the questions being asked.  Hypergraph theory tends to concern questions similar to those of graph theory, such as connectivity and colorability, while the theory of set systems tends to ask non-graph-theoretical questions, such as those of Sperner theory.
There are variant definitions; sometimes edges must not be empty, and sometimes multiple edges, with the same set of nodes, are allowed.
Hypergraphs can be viewed as incidence structures.  In particular, there is a bipartite "incidence graph" or "Levi graph" corresponding to every hypergraph, and conversely, most, but not all, bipartite graphs can be regarded as incidence graphs of hypergraphs.
Hypergraphs have many other names.  In computational geometry, a hypergraph may sometimes be called a range space and then the hyperedges are called ranges.
In cooperative game theory, hypergraphs are called simple games (voting games); this notion is applied to solve problems in social choice theory.  In some literature edges are referred to as hyperlinks or connectors.Special kinds of hypergraphs include: k-uniform ones, as discussed briefly above; clutters, where no edge appears as a subset of another edge; and abstract simplicial complexes, which contain all subsets of every edge.
The collection of hypergraphs is a category with hypergraph homomorphisms as morphisms.},

The author then develops the notions of transfinite induction and descriptive set theory, with applications to the theory of real functions. The final part of the book presents the tools of "modern" set theory: Martin's Axiom, the Diamond Principle, and elements of forcing.

Almost no underlying assumptions are made, other than that the data can be presented in terms of pair-wise relationships between objects/events. This assumption is used to mine for patterns in the dataset, defining a reduced graph or dataset that boils-down or concentrates information into a more compact form. The resulting extracted structure or set of patterns are manifestly symbolic in nature, as they capture and encode the graph structure of the dataset in terms of a (generative) grammar. This structure is identified as having the formal mathematical structure of a sheaf. In essence, this paper introduces the basic concepts of sheaf theory into the domain of graphical datasets.},

  abstract = {Model-Checking ist ein formales Verifikationsverfahren, in dem das Hauptziel die \"Uberpr\"ufung der Korrektheit von Systemen bez\"uglich gegebener Anforderungen ist. Daneben wird Model-Checking h\"aufig als ein Debugging-Werkzeug eingesetzt. Es wird zur Lokalisierung und Behebung von Fehlern verwendet, wenn das Modell eine gew\"unschte Eigenschaft verletzt. Aus diesem Grund ist die M\"oglichkeit, diagnostische Informationen zu liefern, entscheidend f\"ur die praktische Anwendbarkeit von Model-Checking-Techniken. Gegenbeispiele sind ein wichtiger Vertreter f\"ur solche diagnostische Informationen. Ein Gegenbeispiel besteht in der Regel aus Informationen \"uber das Systemverhalten, welche die Eigenschaftsverletzung belegen und bei der Bestimmung der Ursache dieser Verletzung helfen.{$<$}br /{$>$}Stochastisches Model-Checking erweitert das konventionelle Model-Checking um die Verifikation quantitativer Leistungs- und Verl\"asslichkeitsanforderungen. Der Kern des stochastischen Model-Checking besteht aus einer Reihe numerischer Algorithmen. Diese Algorithmen berechnen die Wahrscheinlichkeitswerte, die  \"uber die Erf\"ullung der zu  \"uberpr\"ufenden Anforderungen entscheiden. Aufgrund der numerischen Natur dieser Algorithmen liefern stochastische Model-Checker keine Gegenbeispiele. Diese Dissertation pr\"asentiert unsere Forschung zur L\"osung dieses Problems. Im Rahmen dieser Forschung ist es uns als erste gelungen, stochastisches Model-Checking um die Generierung und Analyse von Gegenbeispielen zu erweitern. Wir haben das Konzept der Gegenbeispiele in das stochastische Model-Checking eingef\"uhrt und die ersten Methoden zur Generierung und Analyse von Gegenbeispielen entwickelt.{$<$}br /{$>$}Wir beginnen diese Dissertation mit einer Einf\"uhrung in das stochastische Model-Checking. Danach behandeln wir das Konzept von Gegenbeispielen in diesem Zusammenhang. Wir geben eine formale Definition von Gegenbeispielen bez\"uglich g\"angiger stochastischer Modelle. Wir diskutieren anschlie\ss{}end die Aussagef\"ahigkeit von Gegenbeispielen bez\"uglich Debugging und erl\"autern die Kriterien von aussagef\"ahigen Gegenbeispielen. Danach pr\"asentieren wir eine Reihe von neuen Methoden zur Generierung von informativen Gegenbeispielen. Unsere Methoden basieren auf heuristischen, oder auch gerichteten, Suchalgorithmen. Wir untersuchen diese Methoden unter verschiedenen Bedingungen und betrachten deren Vor- und Nachteile. Wir untersuchen deren Anwendbarkeit in der Praxis f\"ur Modelle mit hoher Komplexit\"at. Wir demonstrieren die Effizienz und Skalierbarkeit unserer Methoden anhand von ausf\"uhrlichen Experimenten mit realistischen Fallstudien. Diese Experimente zeigen auch, dass die erzeugten Gegenbeispiele informativ und n\"utzlich bei der Fehlerbehebung sind.{$<$}br /{$>$}Wie wir in dieser Dissertation zeigen werden, sind Gegenbeispiele im stochastischen Model-Checking in der Regel sehr komplex. Infolgedessen stellt die Analyse solcher Gegenbeispiele zu Debugging-Zwecken eine gro\ss{}e Herausforderung f\"ur die Benutzer dar. Wir haben eine Methode zur Unterst\"utzung des Benutzers bei der  Analyse von Gegenbeispielen entwickelt. Diese Methode setzt interaktive Visualisierungstechniken ein, um kausale Faktoren, die die Eigenschaftsverletzung verursacht haben, zu bestimmen.{$<$}br /{$>$}Ein wichtiger Beitrag unserer Forschung ist die Entwicklung eines neuen gerichteten Suchalgorithmus K* zur L\"osung des Problems der k-k\"urzesten-Pfade. Das Problem der k-k\"urzesten-Pfade ist ein allgemeines Problem mit vielen Anwendungsgebieten. Dabei handelt es sich um das Finden der k k\"urzesten Pfade von einem Start- zu einem Zielknoten in einem gerichteten Graphen, wobei k eine beliebige nat\"urliche Zahl ist. Im Gegensatz zu existierenden Algorithmen ist K* auch auf sehr gro\ss{}e und komplexe Graphen effizient anwendbar. Wir demonstrieren die \"Uberlegenheit von K  mit Hilfe von Experimenten im Bereich der Routenplanung im Stra\ss{}ennetz der USA.},
