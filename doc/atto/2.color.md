# General Planning Framework

When making artificial inteligence systems, an important feature is the ability to make decisions and act accordingly. To act, one should plan ahead. This is why the field of automated planning is being actively researched in order to find efficient algorithms to find the best course of action in any given situation. The previous chapter allowed to lay the bases of knowledge representation. How knowledge about eh planning domains are represented is a main factor to take into account in order to choose any planning algorithm.

Automated planning really started being formally investigated after the creation of the Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver (STRIPS) by @fikes_strips_1971. This is one of the most influencial planner, not because of its algorithm but because of its input language. Any planning system needs a way to express the information related to the input problem. Any language done for this purpose is called an *action language*. STRIPS will be mostly remembered for its eponymous action language that is at the base of any modern derivatives.

Nowadays, the language most recognised by the automated planning comunity is Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). It is strongly inspired by STRIPS and uses a Lisp-like syntax to express planning domains and problems. Like STRIPS, it is based on the notion of *actions* and *states*. A state is a set of *fluents* that describe aspect of the world modelized by the domain. Each action has a logic formula over states that allows its correct execution. This requirement is called *precondition*. The mirror image of this notion are possible *effects* which are logic formula that are enforced on the current state after the action is executed. The domain is completed with a problem, most of the time specified in a separate file. The problem basically contains two states: the *initial* and *goal* states. These definitions will be properly formalized in @sec:framework.

## Existing Languages and Frameworks

However, PDDL is far from an universal standard. Some efforts have been made to try and standardize the domain of automated planning in the form of optional requirements. The latest of the PDDL standard is the version 3.1 [@kovacs_bnf_2011]. It has 18 atomic requirements as represented in @fig:pddl_req. Most requirements are parts of PDDL that either increase the complexity of planning significantly or that require extra implementation effort to meet.

Even with that flexibility, PDDL is unable to cover all of automated planning systems. This caused most subdomains of automated planning to be left in a state similar to before PDDL: a zoo of languages and derivatives that aren't interoperable. The reason for this is the fact that PDDL isn't expressive enough to encode more than a limited variation in action and fluent description.


This is easy to witness, especially in two fields: probabilistic and hierarchical planning. 

### Probabilistic Planning Frameworks

Even the IPC's probabilistic track fellback to another specialized standard called RDDL.
