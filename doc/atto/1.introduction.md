Ehlo, this is the author of this thesis. I would like to thank a few people without whom none of this would have been possible.

It was a beautiful morning of June^[![](portraits/nature.jpg) Actual picture of the time] that I first walked the Doua wooded driveways to meet my supervisor team: Samir Aknine and Laetitia Matignon. They have given me their trust in the success of this thesis project. Without their advice and support none of this would have been possible. I would like to thank Samir in particular whom, as a mentor and friend, has listened to me and supported me even in the most difficult moments with compassion and understanding.

I would also like to thank Christine Gertosio, who offered me unfailing support in my teaching department and granted me the opportunity to pursue an ATER offer at \polytech Lyon. It was a real pleasure to teach classes of passionate and enthusiastic students.

I would also like to offer my gratitude to the researchers who helped me in this adventure, in no particular order: Fabrice Jumel, Jacques Saraydaryan, Shirin Sohrabi, Damien Pelier. I would also like to thank Linas Vepstas, who greatly helped me in the mathematical part of this thesis.

Without funding, this work wouldn't have been possible. I would like to thank the \arc (Academic Research Community) research allocation courtesy of the \ara region in France. This organism is acting toward an improvement of the quality of life and of aging.

This work was done with the \ucbl university in the \liris (Laboratory of computeR science in Image and Information Systems). I was part of vibrant and wonderful \sma team (Multi-Agent System). Part of the work was funded by teaching at the university \lumiere and the \polytech engineering school.


Finally, I would like to thank my family for supporting me despite my periods of avolition. I would like to thank in particular my mother Charlotte and my sister Sarah ^[![](portraits/sarah_grea.jpg) Sarah Gréa helping me do the [rubber duck method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).] for having done their best to keep me company and pretend to listen to me talk about the technicalities of my thesis in order to make me progress.

Thank you again.

Je voudrais remercier quelques personnes sans qui rien de cela n'aurait été possible.

C'était une belle matinée de juin^[![](portraits/nature.jpg) Photo de l'époque] que j'ai parcouru pour la première fois les allées boisées de la Doua afin de rencontrer mon équipe encadrante: Samir Aknine et Laetitia Matignon. Ces derniers m'ont accordé leur confiance dans la réussite de ce projet de thèse. Sans leur conseil et soutien rien de cela n'aurait été possible. Je remercie particulièrement Samir, qui en tant qu'encadrant, et ami, a su m'écouter et me soutenir même dans les moments les plus pénibles avec compassion et compréhension.

Je souhaite également remercier Christine Gertosio, qui m'a offert une aide sans faille dans mon service d'enseignement et qui m'a donné l'opportunité d'une offre d'ATER à \polytech Lyon. C'était un véritable plaisir de donner des cours à des promotions d'élèves passionnés et enthousiastes.

Je souhaite également offrir ma gratitude aux chercheurs qui m'ont aidé dans cette aventure, sans ordre particulier: Fabrice Jumel, Jacques Saraydaryan, Shirin Sohrabi,  Damien Pelier. J'aimerais également remercier Linas Vepstas, qui m'a grandement aidé dans la partie mathématique de cette thèse.

Sans financement, ce travail n'aurait pas été possible. Je tiens à remercier l'allocation de recherche du \arc (Academic Research Community) gracieuseté de la région de \ara en France. Cet organisme agit pour l'amélioration de la qualité de vie et du vieillissement.

Ce travail a été réalisé avec l'université \ucbl dans le \liris (Laboratoire de calcul scientifique en Image et Systèmes d'Information). Je faisais partie d'une équipe dynamique et conviviale \sma (Multi-Agent System). Une partie du travail a été financée par l'enseignement à l'université \lumiere et à l'école d'ingénieurs polytech.

Enfin, je tiens à remercier ma famille de m'avoir supporté malgré mes périodes d'avolition. Je voudrais remercier tout particulièrement ma mère Charlotte et ma sœur Sarah^[![](portraits/sarah_grea.jpg) Sarah Gréa m'aidant en utilisant la [méthode du canard en plastique](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9thode_du_canard_en_plastique).] pour avoir fait de leurs mieux pour me tenir compagnie et faire semblant de m'écouter déblatérer des technicités de ma thèse afin de me faire avancer.

# Introduction



## Motivations

The social skills of modern robots are rather poor. Often, it is that lack that inhibits human-robot communication and cooperation. Humans being a social species, they require the use of implicit social cues in order to interact comfortably with an interlocutor. The primary goal of this thesis is to address this issue and create the formal foundations of a system able to help dependent people.

In order to enhance assistance to dependent people, we need to account for any deficiency they might have. An entire field of medicine and computer sciences is already dedicated to helping with the physical deficiencies. In our case we chose to address cognitive deficiencies. The main issue is that the patient is unable or unwilling to express their needs. That is a problem even with human caregivers as the information about their intents needs to be inferred from their past actions.

## Issues

The main issue addressed is the intent recognition problem using Artificial Intelligence (AI). The problem is simple to formulate: from observational data, we need to infer the goals and intent of an external agent. There are several ways to handle this issue. Most approaches use trivial machine learning techniques like Bayesian Networks (BN) or Markovian Decision Processes (MDP). The issue with these common approaches is that they require an extensive amount of training data and need to be trained on each patient. This makes the practicality of such system quite limited. To address this issue, some works proposed hybrid approaches using hand-made plan libraries or enforcing logical constraints on the probabilistic method.

A work from Ramirez @ramirez_plan_2009, added an interesting method to solve those kinds of problems. Indeed, they noticed an interesting parallel of that problem with the field of automated planning. This analogy was made by using the Theory of mind @baker_bayesian_2011, which states that any agent will infer the intent of other agents using a projection of their own expectation on the observed behavior of the other agent.![](graphics/planning_vs_ir.svg){.margin}

This made the use of planning techniques possible to infer intent without the need for extensive and well-crafted plan libraries. Now only the domain of the possible actions, their effects and prerequisites are needed to infer the logical intent of an agent.

The main issue of planning for that particular use is computation time and search space size. This prevents most planners to make any decision before the intent is already realized and therefore being useless for assistance. This time constraint lead to the search of a real-time planner algorithm that is also expressive and flexible to accommodate for dynamic changes.

## Contributions

In order to achieve such a planner, the first step was to formalize what is exactly needed to express a domain. Hierarchical and lenient forms of plans to order gave the most expressivity and flexibility but at the cost of time performance. This is why, a new formalism of knowledge representation was needed in order to increase the speed of the search space exploration while restricting it using semantic inference rules.

While searching for a knowledge representation model, some prototypes were done using standard ontology tools but all proved to be too slow and inexpressive for that application. This made the design of a lighter but more flexible knowledge representation model, a requirement of the project.

Then the planning formalism has to be adapted to our general knowledge representation tool. Since automated planning has a very diverse ecosystem of approaches and paradigms, its standard, the Planning Domain Description Language (PDDL) need use of various extensions. However, No general formalism has been given for PDDL and some approaches often lacks proper extensions (hierarchical planning, plan representation, etc). This is why a new formalism is proposed and compared to the one used as standard of the planning community.

Then finally, a couple of planners were designed to attempt answering the speed and flexibility requirements of human intent recognition. The first one is a prototype that aims to evaluate the advantages of repairing plans to use several heuristics. The second is a more complete prototype derived from the first (without plan repairs), which also implements a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to hierarchical decomposition of composite actions. This allows the algorithm to provide intermediaries plan that, while incomplete, are an abstraction of the result plans. This allows for anytime probability computation using existing techniques of invert planning.
