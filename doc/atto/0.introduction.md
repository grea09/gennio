# Introduction

The social skills of modern robot are rather poor. Often, it is that lack that inhibits human-robot communication and cooperation. Humans being a social species, they require the use of implicit social cues in order to interact comfortably with an interlocutor. The primary goal of this thesis is to adress this issue and create the formal fondations of a system able to help dependant people.

## Thesis Context

The work in this thesis was started in 2014, funded at the time by an \arc  (Academic Research Community) research allocation courtessy of the \ara region in France. This organism is acting toward an improvement of the quality of life and of aging. Hence, the original subject was oriented toward assisting dependant persons using intelligent robots. However, such assistance is often rejected by these people who are also very demanding on the social skills of caregivers.
That's why the work lays on the aspect of intent recognition and collaboration in assistive robotics.

This work was done under the \ucbl university in the \liris (Laboratory of computeR science in Image and Information Systems). I was supervised by Samir Aknine and Laëtitia Matignon from the \sma team (Multi-Agent System). Part of the work was funded by the University \lumiere and by the \polytech engineering school.
